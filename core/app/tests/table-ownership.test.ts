/**
 * Every table has exactly one owning module, and only that module may query it.
 *
 * The import-based check in `module-boundaries.test.ts` cannot see this class of
 * violation at all: raw SQL and Drizzle builders reach another module's table without
 * importing a single thing from it. Twenty such accesses existed across eleven files
 * when this was first measured — a "count everything" helper in `platform/lib` querying
 * six modules' tables, the tracker's website lookup holding its own SQL against
 * `websites` and `goals`, the raw API projecting `analytics_events` itself.
 *
 * Two detector details are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **Untagged template literals are stripped.** The AI module's prompts are long
 *   strings full of `FROM heatmap_points` and column listings — they are what the model
 *   is told about the schema, not queries. Counting them produced seven false positives
 *   and made this module look like the worst offender in the codebase.
 * - **Tagged templates are kept, including `sql<Row[]>` and `pgSql`.** An early version
 *   stripped anything preceded by `>`, which silently missed every generic-typed query —
 *   the exact form `tracker-website.repository.ts` uses. A detector with a false
 *   negative is worse than none, because it reads as a clean bill of health.
